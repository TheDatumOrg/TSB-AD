class IForest(BaseDetector):
    """Wrapper of scikit-learn Isolation Forest with more functionalities.

    The IsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a
    feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and
    minimum values of the selected feature.
    See :cite:`liu2008isolation,liu2012isolation` for details.

    Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
    number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
    length from the root node to the terminating node.

    This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a
    measure of normality and our decision function.

    Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies.
    Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path
    lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.

    max_samples : int or float, optional (default="auto")
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If "auto", then `max_samples=min(256, n_samples)`.

        If max_samples is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used for all trees (no sampling).

    contamination : float in (0., 0.5), optional (default=0.1)
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Used when fitting to define the threshold
        on the decision function.

    max_features : int or float, optional (default=1.0)
        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.
            - If float, then draw `max_features * X.shape[1]` features.

    bootstrap : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training
        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement
        is performed.

    n_jobs : integer, optional (default=1)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores.

    behaviour : str, default='old'
        Behaviour of the ``decision_function`` which can be either 'old' or
        'new'. Passing ``behaviour='new'`` makes the ``decision_function``
        change to match other anomaly detection algorithm API which will be
        the default behaviour in the future. As explained in details in the
        ``offset_`` attribute documentation, the ``decision_function`` becomes
        dependent on the contamination parameter, in such a way that 0 becomes
        its natural threshold to detect outliers.

        .. versionadded:: 0.7.0
           ``behaviour`` is added in 0.7.0 for back-compatibility purpose.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           ``behaviour='old'`` is deprecated in sklearn 0.20 and will not be
           possible in 0.22.

        .. deprecated:: 0.22
           ``behaviour`` parameter will be deprecated in sklearn 0.22 and
           removed in 0.24.

        .. warning::
            Only applicable for sklearn 0.20 above.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator.

    max_samples_ : integer
        The actual number of samples

    decision_scores_ : numpy array of shape (n_samples,)
        The outlier scores of the training data.
        The higher, the more abnormal. Outliers tend to have higher
        scores. This value is available once the detector is
        fitted.

    threshold_ : float
        The threshold is based on ``contamination``. It is the
        ``n_samples * contamination`` most abnormal samples in
        ``decision_scores_``. The threshold is calculated for generating
        binary outlier labels.

    labels_ : int, either 0 or 1
        The binary labels of the training data. 0 stands for inliers
        and 1 for outliers/anomalies. It is generated by applying
        ``threshold_`` on ``decision_scores_``.
