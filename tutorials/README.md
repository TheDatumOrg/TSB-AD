## TSB-AD Tutorial

ðŸ”¥ Tutorial: `Advances in Time-Series Anomaly Detection: Algorithms, Benchmarks, and Evaluation Measures`. 
Please visit [[Website]](https://thedatumorg.github.io/TSAD-Tutorial/).

ðŸ”¥ Navigate a process-centric taxonomy of anomaly detection techniques: [[Website]](https://boniolp.github.io/TSADtaxonomy/).

This directory provides hands-on examples and executable notebooks designed to facilitate a clear understanding of how to use and evaluate anomaly detection (AD) models within the TSB-AD framework.

* `a_quick_start.ipynb`: End-to-end workflow for running models in TSB-AD + plotting function to visualize time series and anomalies.
